# Roadmap

Things to make in later releases.

## v2.0

+ AttributeSetterTrait    
Will set `$this->attributes['attributeName']` instead of `$this->attributeName` by default. But if `$this->attributeName` exists, it will set that.
+ AttributeGetterTrait    
Will get `$this->attributes['attributeName']` instead of `$this->attributeName` by default. But if `$this->attributeName` exists, it will get that.
