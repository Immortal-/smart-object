# Roadmap

Things to make in later releases.

## v2.0

[*] AttributeSetterTrait - will set `$this->attributes['attributeName']` instead of `$this->attributeName` by default. But if `$this->attributeName` exists, it will set that.
[*] AttributeGetterTrait - will get `$this->attributes['attributeName']` instead of `$this->attributeName` by default. But if `$this->attributeName` exists, it will get that.
